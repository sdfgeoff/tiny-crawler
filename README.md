This is a small RC vehicle made to be drivn by four continous rotation servos. It's final size is 12.5 x 8 x 5cm. It is intended to be fitted wth FPV gear so it can be operated, well, remotely. 

I'm using an ESP32 as the brains for this project - making this machine programmable, but you can use whatever you like.

If you want to make edits to the files, they were made with blender (blender.org). You can make your edits in Wheel.blend or CompleteDesign.blend, and then open the files in the "outputs" folder
to export them to stl. If you're on linux, you can install and use use a program called "tup" to do this export process automatically.
