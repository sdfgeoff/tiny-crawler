All the stuff I created is released under CC-BY-SA, so you can do what you like with it,
but if you share it you should attribute myself as the original source.

In this project, the following are NOT created by me:

 - Model/resources/HDRI_029_Sky_Cloudy_Ref.hdr is from HDRI Hub and is used under CC-BY 3.0
 - esp32tex.jpg is from expressif, and is used under the apache license. Technically to comply, I should have a copy of the license here, but hopefully you can go find one.
